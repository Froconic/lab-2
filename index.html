            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Life long learning is not only a passion of mine but something that I try to instill with my students.
                I am currently a STEM teacher at Mid-Prairie Middle School where I have the privilege of teaching
                every student.

            <div class="stem-curric"></div>
            <ul>Here is the breakdown of what I teach:
                <li><strong>5th Grade: Engineering Principles</strong></li>
                <li><strong>6th Grade: Computer Science Discoveries</strong></li>
                <li><strong>7th Grade: Design & Modeling</strong></li>
                <li><strong>8th Grade: Automation & Robotics</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Sounds interesting, right. My day at school maybe hectic but it is certainly never boring and
                the kids always keep me on my toes!

                and shares my love for tinkering and building. We have two very energetic boys that keep us on our toes.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When I am not running after my kids or teaching, I can often be found either at the pool or outside.
                I am one of our local YMCA swim coaches, where I am able to share my passion of swimming with others.
                In addition to coaching, I love to run, hike, scuba dive and work in the garden .

                students in
                a school but because I have spent so much of my life learning. Below is a bit about my educational
                background.
