            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>Life long learning is not only a passion of mine but something that I try to instill with my students.
                I am currently a STEM teacher at Mid-Prairie Middle School where I have the privilege of teaching
                every student.

            </p>
            <div class="stem-curric"></div>
            <ul>Here is the breakdown of what I teach:</ul>
            <li><strong>5th Grade: Engineering Principles</strong></li>
            <li>6th Grade: Computer Science Discoveries</li>
            <li>7th Grade: Design & Modeling</li>
            <li>8th Grade: Automation & Robotics</li>
            </div>
            <p>Sounds interesting, right. My day at school maybe hectic but it is certainly never boring and
                the kids always keep me on my toes!

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <img src="img/family.jpg" alt="This is a picture of my family" width="200px" />
            <p>Family is extremely important to me. I have been married to my best friend, Jeff Huber
                for 14 years. We have two very energetic boys that keep us on our toes. The oldest, Tyson,
                is 9 years old. My youngest, Kaden, is 7. We also have three fur babies. Max and Shadow,
                our cats, love to torment our Golden Retriever.

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When I am not running after my kids or teaching, I can often be found either at the pool or outside.
                I am one of our local YMCA swim coaches, where I am able to share my passion of swimming with others.
                In addition to coaching, I love to run, hike, scuba dive and work in the garden .
